# üí∞ Funds Management Guide

Understanding where your money goes and how to withdraw it.

## üìç **Where Do Purchase Funds Go?**

### **Answer: To Your Smart Contract Address**

When users purchase items, ETH is sent to the **smart contract itself**, not directly to your personal wallet.

**Your Contract Addresses:**
- **Sepolia:** `0x5b52b0af04ce693233169a29a185d0b4a7a88907`
- **Base Sepolia:** `0x5b52b0af04ce693233169a29a185d0b4a7a88907`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Current Contract Issue**

### **Your Current Contract (GameStore.sol):**

```solidity
// ‚ö†Ô∏è NO WITHDRAWAL FUNCTION!
function purchaseItem(string memory itemId, uint256 price) external payable {
    require(msg.value >= price, "Insufficient funds");
    emit ItemPurchased(msg.sender, itemId, price);
    // ETH comes in but there's NO way to get it out!
}
```

**Problem:** 
- ‚úÖ ETH enters the contract
- ‚ùå ETH is **permanently locked** (no withdrawal function)
- ‚ùå You **cannot** access the funds

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution: Upgrade to GameStoreV2**

I've created an improved version with withdrawal capabilities!

### **New Contract: GameStoreV2.sol**

```solidity
contract GameStoreV2 {
    address public owner; // Your wallet address
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender; // You become the owner
    }
    
    // Same purchase function
    function purchaseItem(string memory itemId, uint256 price) external payable {
        require(msg.value >= price, "Insufficient funds");
        emit ItemPurchased(msg.sender, itemId, price);
    }
    
    // ‚úÖ NEW: Withdraw all funds
    function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        (bool success, ) = owner.call{value: balance}("");
        require(success, "Withdrawal failed");
    }
    
    // ‚úÖ NEW: Withdraw specific amount
    function withdrawAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        (bool success, ) = owner.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Withdrawal failed");
    }
    
    // ‚úÖ NEW: Check balance
    function getBalance() external view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Only YOU (the owner) can withdraw
- ‚úÖ Withdraw all or specific amounts
- ‚úÖ Check contract balance anytime
- ‚úÖ Transfer ownership if needed

## üöÄ **How to Upgrade & Withdraw Funds**

### **Step 1: Deploy New Contract**

```bash
# Deploy GameStoreV2
npm run deploy:sepolia

# Or for Base Sepolia
npm run deploy:baseSepolia
```

**Update your `.env` with new contract address:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GAMESTORE_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA=0xNewAddress...
NEXT_PUBLIC_GAMESTORE_ADDRESS_BASE=0xNewAddress...
```

### **Step 2: Update Frontend**

The frontend will automatically use the new contract address from `.env`.

### **Step 3: Check Contract Balance**

```bash
# On Sepolia
npx hardhat console --network sepolia

# In console:
const contract = await viem.getContractAt(
  "GameStoreV2", 
  "0xYourNewAddress..."
);
const balance = await contract.read.getBalance();
console.log(`Balance: ${viem.formatEther(balance)} ETH`);
```

### **Step 4: Withdraw Funds**

```bash
# Withdraw from Sepolia
npm run withdraw:sepolia

# Or from Base Sepolia
npm run withdraw:baseSepolia
```

**What happens:**
1. Script checks contract balance
2. Shows your current balance
3. Withdraws all funds to YOUR wallet
4. Shows confirmation and explorer link

## üìä **Check Contract Balance Online**

### **Sepolia:**
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x5b52b0af04ce693233169a29a185d0b4a7a88907

### **Base Sepolia:**
https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x5b52b0af04ce693233169a29a185d0b4a7a88907

**What you'll see:**
- Total ETH held by contract
- All transactions (purchases)
- Event logs (ItemPurchased events)

---

## üí° **Understanding the Difference**

### **Contract Address (Smart Contract)**
- **Purpose:** Holds the store logic
- **Function:** Receives purchases, stores ETH
- **Access:** Anyone can interact (buy items)
- **Example:** `0x5b52b0af04ce693233169a29a185d0b4a7a88907`

### **Owner Address (Your Personal Wallet)**
- **Purpose:** Your MetaMask wallet
- **Function:** Receives withdrawn funds
- **Access:** Only YOU control via private key
- **Example:** `0xYourWalletAddress...`

### **Flow:**
```
Customer ‚Üí Contract (holds) ‚Üí Owner withdraws ‚Üí Your Wallet (keeps)
```

---

## üîê **Security Best Practices**

### **1. Only Owner Can Withdraw**
```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this");
    _;
}
```

### **2. Check Before Withdrawal**
Always verify contract balance before withdrawing:
```bash
npm run withdraw:sepolia
# Script shows: "Contract Balance: 0.005 ETH"
```

### **3. Gas Costs**
Withdrawal costs gas (~$0.50-$2.00):
- Deducted from YOUR wallet
- Not from the contract balance

### **4. Transfer Ownership Carefully**
```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external onlyOwner {
    owner = newOwner;
}
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Only do this if you're selling the store!

## üìã **Withdrawal Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Regular Withdrawal**
```bash
# Customer bought 5 items @ 0.001 ETH each
# Contract has: 0.005 ETH

npm run withdraw:sepolia
# ‚úÖ You receive: 0.005 ETH (minus gas)
```

### **Scenario 2: Partial Withdrawal**
```bash
# Contract has: 0.1 ETH
# You want: 0.05 ETH

npx hardhat console --network sepolia
await contract.write.withdrawAmount(parseEther("0.05"));
# ‚úÖ Contract keeps: 0.05 ETH
# ‚úÖ You receive: 0.05 ETH
```

### **Scenario 3: Emergency Full Withdrawal**
```bash
npm run withdraw:sepolia
# ‚úÖ Empties contract, sends everything to you
```

---

## üßÆ **Example Calculation**

### **Revenue Tracking:**

| Transaction | Customer Pays | Gas Fee | To Contract |
|-------------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Purchase #1 | 0.001 ETH | 0.0005 ETH | 0.001 ETH |
| Purchase #2 | 0.0015 ETH | 0.0005 ETH | 0.0015 ETH |
| Purchase #3 | 0.002 ETH | 0.0006 ETH | 0.002 ETH |
| **Total** | **0.0045 ETH** | **0.0016 ETH** | **0.0045 ETH** |

**Your Withdrawal:**
- Contract Balance: `0.0045 ETH`
- Withdrawal Gas: `-0.0008 ETH` (from your wallet)
- **You Receive: 0.0045 ETH**

---

## ‚ö° **Quick Commands**

```bash
# Check balance (manual)
npx hardhat console --network sepolia
await viem.getBalance({ address: "0xYourContract..." })

# Withdraw all funds
npm run withdraw:sepolia
npm run withdraw:baseSepolia

# Deploy new contract with withdrawal
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

## üéØ **Recommended Workflow**

### **For New Deployments:**
1. ‚úÖ Deploy **GameStoreV2** (has withdrawal)
2. ‚úÖ Update `.env` with new address
3. ‚úÖ Test purchase flow
4. ‚úÖ Verify you can withdraw

### **For Existing Contract:**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Current contract has NO withdrawal
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Funds are LOCKED forever
3. ‚úÖ Deploy GameStoreV2 to new address
4. ‚úÖ Update frontend to use new contract
5. ‚úÖ Old contract funds are unfortunately lost

## 📊 **Before vs After:**

| Category | Before | After | Change |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Metadata Files** | 17 files | 11 files | -6 files |
| **Lighthouse Items** | 17 items | 11 items | -6 items |
| **Armor Items** | 4 | 0 | -4 |
| **Bundle Items** | 2 | 0 | -2 |

## 🔍 **Files Updated:**

### **1. Metadata Files:**
```bash
# DELETED:
assets/inventory/armor-001.json
assets/inventory/armor-002.json
assets/inventory/armor-003.json
assets/inventory/armor-004.json
assets/inventory/bundle-001.json
assets/inventory/bundle-002.json
```

### **2. Lighthouse CID Mappings:**
```bash
# Updated (armor & bundles removed):
assets/inventory-cids.json
frontend/public/inventory-cids.json
```

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

### **1. IPFS Data Still Exists:**
The data is still on IPFS/Lighthouse servers:
- The CIDs are still valid
- The metadata can still be accessed via URL
- We just removed the mappings from our app

### **2. Store Already Updated:**
The armor/bundles were already removed from the store pages earlier, so no store changes needed.

### **3. Remaining Items:**
Your app now has 11 items with Lighthouse metadata:
- 7 Swords
- 3 Weapons
- 2 Claws
- 1 Reaper
- 1 Shield (old)

But the STORE shows 14 items (with sword-005, sword-006, sword-007, twin-001 that don't have Lighthouse metadata yet).

---

## 🎯 **What This Means:**

### **Inventory Modal:**
If users try to view details for armor/bundle items:
- ❌ No Lighthouse metadata found
- ✅ Will show error or fallback to basic info

### **Store:**
- ✅ Already removed from both stores
- ✅ Users can't purchase armor/bundles
- ✅ Clean item list

### **Lighthouse:**
- ✅ Only 11 items have metadata now
- ✅ No armor/bundle confusion
- ✅ Cleaner data structure

---

## 📝 **Next Steps (Optional):**

### **Option 1: Leave As-Is**
- 14 items in store (all with images)
- 11 items with Lighthouse metadata
- 3 items (sword-005, sword-006, sword-007) + twin-001 only have local data

### **Option 2: Upload Missing Metadata**
Upload Lighthouse metadata for:
- sword-005 (Artis Sword)
- sword-006 (Cosmic Sword)
- sword-007 (Ether Sword)
- twin-001 (Heavenly Twin Sword)

Run:
```bash
npm run lighthouse:inventory:upload
```

---

## ✅ **Summary:**

**DELETED:**
- ❌ 6 metadata files
- ❌ 6 Lighthouse mappings
- ❌ All armor bundles
- ❌ All special bundles

**REMAINING:**
- ✅ 11 items with Lighthouse metadata
- ✅ 14 items in store
- ✅ Clean, organized inventory

**All armor and bundle items successfully removed!** 🗑️✨

The app now focuses on swords, weapons, claws, and special items only.
